DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK 1 : "Big Data Analysis of Financial Risk within Big 4 Firms Using PySpark"

This project leverages PySpark for scalable financial risk analysis within the Big 4 accounting firms. The process begins with loading large-scale datasets into Spark DataFrames, followed by an initial data exploration phase to understand the datasetâ€™s structure, distribution, and key attributes.
In the data preparation stage, the data is cleansed by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring proper data type casting to facilitate accurate computations.Next, the analysis proceeds to descriptive statistics, where key aggregated metrics are computed for each firm. A custom risk score is derived based on factors such as audit performance, compliance records, and reported financial anomalies.

"Time series analysis" is then applied using PySpark window functions to capture temporal trends and shifts, especially in compliance effectiveness and audit outcomes. This enables identification of long-term risk patterns and short-term irregularities.
"The predictive modeling" phase incorporates Linear Regression to forecast the number of fraud cases detected. An integrated alert system flags potential risk events by analyzing the predicted fraud status and its correlation with specific industries, generating targeted Industry Risk Alerts.

Finally, the analysis is enhanced with a comprehensive "visualization section" featuring histograms for distribution patterns, line plots to track time-based trends, correlation heatmaps to reveal variable relationships, and hexbin plots to detect dense clusters of financial risk.
